          Kharkiv [Харків; Xarkiv]. Map: III-17. (Photo: Kharkiv panorama.) Ukraine's second-largest city (2005 pop
          1,465,000)
          and the capital of Kharkiv oblast, situated at the confluence of the Lopan River, the Udy River, and the
          Kharkiv</p>
        River. The historic capital of Slobidska Ukraine, it is an important industrial, commercial, communications,
        scientific, and cultural center. From 1920 to 1934 it was the capital of Soviet Ukraine. Kharkiv's proximity
        to
        the
        Donets Basin and its location at the intersection of the trade routes between Russia and the Black Sea and
        central
        Ukraine and Caucasia have facilitated its economic growth. The city is over 300 sq km in area and is divided
        into
        nine raions: Chervonozavodskyi, Dzerzhynskyi, Frunzenskyi, Kominternivskyi, Kyivskyi, Leninskyi, Moskovskyi,
        Ordzhonikidzevskyi, and Zhovtnevyi.

      <div class="most">
        Kharkiv's name is most likely derived from the Kharkiv River. The Russian historian N. Aristov believed it was
        derived from the principal Cuman settlement of Sharukan, which existed near the present-day city. According to
        popular legend, the city is named after a Cossack, Kharko.

      <div class="history">
        History. Kharkiv's vicinity has been settled since the 2nd millennium BC. Bronze Age settlements, Scythian
        kurhans
        (6th–3rd centuries BC), and Sarmatian relics (2nd–1st centuries BC) have been excavated there. Relics of the
        Cherniakhiv culture (2nd–5th centuries AD) have been unearthed in the city, followed by settlements of the
        Siverianians (8th century); their fortified settlement of Donets (dated from the10th century) has been excavated
        nearby.

        From the 13th to the 17th century the large territory around present-day Kharkiv became wild steppe dominated by
        the
        <p>
          Cumans and then by the Tatars. From the early 17th century the territory belonged formally to Muscovy, which
          stationed frontier garrisons there and sent out scouts and explorers to reconnoiter and map the region. Later,
          networks of fortifications against the Crimean Tatars and the Nogay Tatars—the Belgorod line, the Izium line,
          and
        </p>
        the Ukrainian line—were built and settled, mostly by Ukrainian Cossacks, and non-serf villages (slobody, hence
        the
        name ‘Slobidska Ukraine’) and more numerous settlements of refugees from the war-torn Hetman state, Right-Bank
        Ukraine, and Western Ukraine sprang up. By the mid-17th century several such settlements existed in Kharkiv's
        vicinity.

      <div class="text-2">
        The generally accepted date of Kharkiv's founding is 1654/5, when Ukrainian Cossacks led by I. Karkach built a
        fortified settlement on the plateau surrounded by the Kharkiv River and the Lopan River. A fortress was
        completed
        in
        1659. Although they were formally under the jurisdiction of a Muscovite military governor, as military
        frontiersmen
        the Cossacks were allowed to be self-governing, according to ‘Cherkessian custom,’ with the right of free
        settlement, enterprise, and trade, until the reign of Peter I. In 1655 the population of Kharkiv was about
        2,000,
        including about 600 Cossacks.

        For the remainder of the 17th and most of the 18th century Kharkiv remained a defensive outpost; the Russian
        garrison and artisans and merchants lived within the fortress, but most of the Cossack population lived in
        nearby
        expanding slobody and engaged in farming, fishing, beekeeping, and barter trade. >From 1659 to 1765 Kharkiv was
        the
        capital of Kharkiv regiment, one of the largest Cossack administrative and military units in Slobidska Ukraine.
        In
        1660–2 a new citadel, with administrative buildings (a governor's house) and churches, was built.
